Hi, i'm Esin Güler. I'm mostly interested in cyber security but also like every engineer should like i would love to collaborate and solve problems.
I didn't get the chance to work with a team but i would get very exited if i can. 
And also there is simply NOTHİNG that i wouldn't love to learn.(Except history classes)
