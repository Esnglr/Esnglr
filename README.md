Hi, i'm Esin Güler. I'm mostly interested in cyber security but also like every engineer should like i would love to collaborate and solve problems.
I also just got the chance to work as a team in a club in my university and i'm absouletly loving it thanks to my club friends. 
And also there is simply NOTHİNG that i wouldn't love to learn.(Except history classes)
